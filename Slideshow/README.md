# Slideshow

![this is how it looks in its most basic configuration](https://img.skitch.com/20120904-ecbtkh24gk78qe1yicmebkcwj4.png)

Slideshow module for ss3 based on [jQuery Cycle plugin](http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/). Personally my favorite, because its really easy to implement and has an excellent documentation and 100s of different options

This module can work with any js library of sliders you can find on internet, since almost all works the same way, you just need to add your js and youre done.

##How to use it
You need to attach the extension to the pages where you want to use it:

Object::add_extension('HomePage','Slideshow');

Object::add_extension('HomePage','Slideshow_Controller');

## Requires
[SortableGridField module](https://github.com/UndefinedOffset/SortableGridField) <- Thanks for this one, SS3 community will love you forever!
